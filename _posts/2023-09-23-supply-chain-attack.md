Recent events show that supply chain attacks in the Web3 world can have very bad effects, such as the theft of digital assets, the disruption of system functionality, the extortion of businesses, and the spread of malware on a large scale.

## Case Study

**Ankr - Lost approximately $5 million**

On December 2, 2022, the [Ankr protocol](https://twitter.com/ankr/status/1598624443642703872) on the BNB chain suffered a major exploit due to a governance key compromise. This breach enabled an attacker to mint a massive 10 trillion aBNBc tokens and drain the DEX pool, resulting in approximately $5 million in losses. The [post-mortem report](https://twitter.com/ankrstaking/status/1605270645864013847) revealed that former Ankr team members orchestrated the breach through a supply chain attack by [injecting malicious code packages](https://www.ankr.com/blog/after-action-report-our-findings-from-abnbc-token-exploit/). These packages had the potential to compromise Ankr's private keys each time a legitimate project update was executed. This dumping of a massive amount of aBNBc tokens on a decentralized exchange opened the door for another exploit in which Helio Protocol was attacked and profited the attacker by approximately $15.5 million.

**Python Package web3-essential**

On January 30, 2023, a zero-day exploit was discovered in the Python package [web3-essential](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/supply-chain-attack-by-new-malicious-python-package-web3-essential/), which had been published on January 26, 2023. Notably, the package's author, Trexon, joined the repository on the same day of publication. In an attempt to avoid suspicion, Trexon provided a brief project description and assigned a unique version number, '1.0.4b0'. This package, however, contained malicious code within its installation script. This code downloaded and executed an external binary file during installation. This malicious executable was specifically designed to compromise Discord accounts and web browsers, spreading malware with the intent of stealing sensitive information, including login credentials, passwords, and credit card details.

## How Supply Chain Attacks Occur

Supply chain attacks, with their multifaceted exploitation of development and distribution processes, demand a deep understanding for effective defense. Malicious actors employ ingenious methods that underscore the importance of robust security measures. Staying ahead of these threats is essential to protecting digital assets and maintaining trust in your organization's security practices in our rapidly evolving environment.

### State Sponsored Groups

Nation-states often engage in supply chain attacks for espionage or cyberwarfare purposes. These well-resourced actors have the means to infiltrate supply chains at multiple levels, compromising the security and integrity of critical systems. Profit-oriented cybercriminal groups prioritize financial gain, exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities for data theft, fraud, and ransomware attacks at various stages.

### Malicious Component Injection and Counterfeit Projects

Attackers introduce hidden malicious code into open-source components like plugins, extensions, and libraries. They also create counterfeit versions of popular projects, deceiving users. Users unknowingly adopt these compromised components and counterfeit projects, resulting in unauthorized access, data breaches, and system manipulation.

### Infiltration and Trust Exploitation

Trust is the cornerstone of supply chains. In open-source project communities, attackers gradually gain trust by infiltrating and actively participating. They may leverage changes in project administration or request elevated privileges. Once established as trusted members, they introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code, thereby compromising the integrity of supply chains.

### Exploitation of Third-Party Dependencies

Organizations depend on third-party vendors, open-source software, and service providers to enhance efficiency and innovation. However, this reliance can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly managed. Attackers often target widely used third-party libraries, inserting malicious code. These tainted libraries are then unknowingly adopted by open source projects, and when users of these projects update their systems, they inadvertently install compromised libraries, creating opportunities for large-scale exploitation.

### Deceptive Tactics and Misinformation Campaigns

Attackers employ deceptive tactics, including creating counterfeit projects, manipulating documentation, or hijacking user support channels. They use misinformation campaigns like fake reviews and social media promotion to deceive users. This leads to users unknowingly adopting compromised software, resulting in various security risks.

### Organizational Infiltration and Hiring Exploitation

Attackers target organizations closely tied to open source projects. They may apply for jobs, infiltrate, and exploit their positions to introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors into project code. This allows them to compromise the supply chain from within the organization.

### Sabotaging Reputation and Covert Misconduct

Attackers infiltrate project communities and build trust over time. They engage in covert misconduct, such as advocating insecure practices, inserting subtle bugs, or pushing controversial changes. This erodes the project's reputation, causes users to abandon it, and serves the attacker's interests.

## Guide to Mitigating Supply Chain Attack Risks

Mitigating the risks of supply chain attacks requires proactive measures and a comprehensive security strategy. Here are key steps that organizations can take to prevent these attacks:

### Package Assessment

To defend against supply chain attacks, it's advised to delay package updates for 3-6 months, allowing the open source community to spot and fix vulnerabilities. Before updating, review the release notes for security enhancements. Prioritize packages with high download counts: 50,000 weekly for 6-month-old packages and 1 million weekly for those 3 months old. This approach, combining update delays with download metrics, bolsters software security by leveraging both time and widespread user scrutiny.

### Access Control and Least Privilege

Enforce strict access controls, employing the principle of least privilege to restrict authorized personnel's access rights. Implement strong access controls by limiting edit access to essential personnel and ensuring multi-factor authentication (MFA) for their accounts. Regularly review and update access permissions, monitoring user activities and access patterns, particularly those with elevated privileges. Utilizing a monitoring system aids in detecting suspicious activities or unauthorized changes, enabling rapid response and threat mitigation.

### Code Audits and Continuous Monitoring

Boost your supply chain security by conducting routine code audits on software components and dependencies. Implement continuous monitoring to swiftly detect anomalies or unauthorized changes. Regular security audits and risk assessments are vital for pinpointing vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Proactive issue identification and resolution significantly reduce the risk of supply chain attacks. Maintain a schedule for periodic audits and assessments to ensure the longevity of your robust security measures.

### Vendor and Supplier Assessment

Before integrating third-party libraries or dependencies, scrutinize their security measures and reputation by conducting a comprehensive assessment of their suppliers and other third-party vendors. Evaluate their cybersecurity practices, track records, and commitment to security. Research their history for vulnerabilities and responsiveness to security matters. Verify software package authenticity through digital signatures or trusted package managers before adoption.

### Incident Response Planning

Despite a security-focused approach, vulnerabilities can emerge. Establish a strong incident response plan covering detection, containment, and mitigation of supply chain breaches. This plan plays a crucial role in minimizing damage and expediting recovery during supply chain attacks. Detail team roles, attack identification, containment steps, and system as well as data restoration procedures. Ensure periodic plan updates and testing to maintain its effectiveness.
