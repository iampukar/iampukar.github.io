Hi, Iâ€™m Pukar Acharya, currently working as an independent security researcher. My passion for artificial intelligence, security, and blockchain drives my dedication to researching industry needs and developing scalable applications.

With over 7 years of experience, I have held roles like Cyber Security Consultant at Neptune Mutual, Deep Learning Engineer at IME Ltd., and Business Analyst at Cargill Business Services.

My areas of expertise include data science, machine learning, deep learning, web application security, infrastructure security, and smart contract security. I am proficient in Python, NodeJS, Golang, and Solidity. Throughout my career, I have developed a knack for creating efficient applications and solving complex problems.

Outside of work, I am eager to learn new things and stay updated with trends in technology, web3, and security. I enjoy meeting new people and discussing technological advancements and security challenges. In my leisure time, I love watching TV series, playing FIFA, and engaging in various activities that keep me refreshed.

Please feel free to contact me via my social media accounts below.
