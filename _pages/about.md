Hi, I'm Pukar Acharya, currently working as an Independent Security Researcher. My passion for artificial intelligence, security, and blockchains drives my dedication to researching pressing industry needs and developing scalable applications in these fields.

Over the past 7 years, I have held various roles, including Cyber Security Consultant at Neptune Mutual, Deep Learning Engineer at IME Ltd., and Business Analyst at Cargill Business Services.

My core skills include Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Web Application Security, Infrastructure Security, and the security of smart contracts. I am proficient in multiple programming languages, including Python, NodeJS, Golang, and Solidity. Additionally, I have extensive experience with Artificial Intelligence frameworks and libraries. Throughout my career, I have developed a knack for building scalable applications and solving complex problems, ensuring that the solutions I create meet both individual and organizational needs.

Outside of work, I am always eager to learn new things and stay updated with the latest trends in technology, web3, and security. I enjoy meeting new people and engaging in discussions about global issues, which broadens my perspective and enriches my understanding of the world. In my leisure time, I love watching TV series, playing FIFA, and indulging in various activities that keep me refreshed and motivated.

Please feel free to contact me via my social media accounts.
