  abstract = {Many-a-times the garbage bins located in some significant position get filled up completely, and yet concerned authorities aren’t aware of the event. Additionally, the garbage collector has to make unnecessary trips to collect garbage from the bins that aren’t completely filled. This isn’t a cost-effective method of garbage collection. To avoid this situation, we came up with the idea of an e-monitoring system for smart garbage collection. The garbage bins are equipped with ultrasonic sensors attached to a NodeMCU unit. The unit has an inbuilt Wi-Fi module, which regularly sends the garbage level status from the associated bins over the web browser. Additionally, an email notification is also sent as soon as the garbage level crosses a threshold value, say 90% of the total depth of the bins. The project aims to reduce the human effort for garbage collection, while the statistical representation of data collection provides a prototype for future research and learning.},

  title = {Automatic Number Plate Extraction},
  author = {Pukar Acharya and Yadav Nandakumar and Gururaja H.S.},
  abstract = {Automatic Number Plate Extraction is an innovative system where characters are extracted from a number plate image. Many image processing steps are used in order to extract only text from a number plate image. Since the image is more susceptible to noise and many other unwanted objects, noise is first removed from the image. Before image preprocessing steps, the RGB image is converted to a gray-scale image, and the image is resized while keeping the aspect ratio the same. Morphological processing is used to detect text more accurately. The image is converted to a double. The edge detection method is used to detect edges, and the image intensity level is increased. Objects with gaps are filled. After edge detection, the image might contain many horizontal and vertical lines. These lines are removed from the image to extract only the text from the image. After applying these preprocessing steps, the image is left with a few smaller, unwanted objects. These unwanted objects are removed from the image, and the texts from the number plate are extracted.},
